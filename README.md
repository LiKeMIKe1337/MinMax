Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning)
Welcome to an advanced Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe featuring AI players powered by the Minimax Algorithm and its optimized version using Alpha-Beta Pruning.
This project not only lets you play against the AI but also compare the performance of the two algorithms in terms of speed and node exploration.

‚ú® Features
Play Human vs AI (Minimax or Alpha-Beta).

Watch AI vs AI matches.

Compare performance between standard Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Real-time display of:

Number of nodes explored

Time taken for decision-making

Speedup and efficiency comparison

üìÇ Project Structure
TicTacToe class: Handles the game board, moves, and win conditions.

Player classes:

HumanPlayer: Takes input from user.

RandomComputerPlayer: Random move selector (extendable).

MinimaxPlayer: AI using Minimax Algorithm.

AlphaBetaPlayer: AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning.

play() function: Manages gameplay between two players.

compare_algorithms() function: Benchmarks Minimax vs Alpha-Beta.

üß† Algorithm Insights
Minimax:
A recursive backtracking algorithm that simulates all possible moves to pick the best one.

Alpha-Beta Pruning:
An optimization that cuts off branches that cannot affect the final decision, greatly reducing computation.

After running Compare Algorithm Performance, you'll see:

Nodes explored by each algorithm

Time taken

Percentage of node reduction
