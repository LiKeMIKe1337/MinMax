# ü§ñ Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview
This project is a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring AI players powered by the **Minimax Algorithm** and its optimized version with **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
You can play against AI or watch AI vs AI matches, while comparing their performance in terms of **speed** and **node exploration**.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Play **Human vs AI** (Minimax or Alpha-Beta)
- Watch **AI vs AI** matches
- Compare performance between **standard Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**

### Real-time display of:
- Number of **nodes explored**
- **Time** taken for decision-making
- **Speedup** and **efficiency comparison**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
- **TicTacToe** class: Handles board and win conditions
- **HumanPlayer** class: Handles user input
- **RandomComputerPlayer** class: (Optional random AI)
- **MinimaxPlayer** class: AI using Minimax
- **AlphaBetaPlayer** class: AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **play()** function: Manages gameplay
- **compare_algorithms()** function: Benchmarks Minimax vs Alpha-Beta

Sample Board Layout:
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
```

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed (only time and random from the standard library)

üß† Algorithm Insights
 __Minimax__
A recursive backtracking algorithm that simulates all possible moves to pick the best one.

Alpha-Beta Pruning
An optimization that cuts off branches that cannot affect the final decision, greatly reducing computation.

After running Compare Algorithm Performance, you'll see:

- Nodes explored by each algorithm

- Time taken

- Percentage of node reduction

- Speed improvement factor
